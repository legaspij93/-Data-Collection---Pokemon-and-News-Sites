            "full_article": "\n\nMetro Manila (CNN Philippines) \u2014 The need for movement restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a transition towards digital banking.\nMore Filipinos have turned to online fund transfers instead of ATM transactions\u00a0when the enhanced community quarantine was imposed in March 2020. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno earlier reported a 25 percent increase in online bank transactions for the first one and a half months of the ECQ, compared to 45 days before strict stay-at-home rules took effect.\nRecognizing this shift in customer behavior, the BSP late last year approved a new set of rules for fully online banks or those that accept deposits and fund transfer requests \u2013 as legitimate entities even if they do not have brick-and-mortar branches.\nFollowing the release of the banking industry framework, a digital-only bank based in Singapore sought to launch in the Philippines.\nDigital bank UNObank is currently working with regulators to obtain its license to operate in the Philippines and is on a mission to help bring unbanked Filipinos into the formal banking system.\n\u201cFinancial inclusion is a big challenge in the Philippines,\u201d UNObank founder Manish Bhai told CNN Philippines\u2019 New Day on Friday.\n\u201cFifty million people are unbanked, so making banking available to the unbanked or bringing innovative products and solutions - which are simpler and more competitive to those who already have bank accounts - is a very exciting and eventful journey,\u201d he added.\nHelping UNObank realize its goal is a global financial technology (fintech) company, Backbase, with their Asia Pacific hub in Singapore.\nProviding a \u201cdigital-first\u201d engagement banking platform to financial institutions, Backbase\u2019s digital-first strategy stems from a focus on the customer experience. This includes addressing the various issues and pain points throughout the customer banking journey to help banks create better digital customer experiences.\n\u201cWe believe that a one-single platform that we are bringing to the table should be able to do four things - delight customers of banks, empower the employees of banks, orchestrate a lot of value from an ecosystem perspective and finally, digitize these operations,\u201d Riddhi Dutta, regional head for ASEAN and India at Backbase, said in an interview on New Day.\nRiddhi also shared that there are opportunities for incumbent banks to work together with fintech firms to leverage each other\u2019s skillsets and niche. This allows banks to have better operation efficiency to stay much more agile while focusing on customer\u2019s needs.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we want to make a difference to the way people are banking and the way people are doing their financial transactions,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
